    "1.1 simple linear regression models the relationship between a single predictor and outcome variable by fitting a straight line to the data. multiple linear regression includes multiple independant variables to predict the outcome. the benefits of multiple linear regression is that it can considers multiple factors which could show more complex relationships between the variables, this is helpful when the outcome is possible affected by multiple variables which allows a better understanding between relationship and influencing factors\n",

    "the contradiction is that the r-squared value is low which means the model only explains 17.6% of the vairability in the outcome variable, however many of the coefficients are very large which shows very strong evidence against the null hypothesis. so how can there be a relation between the predictor and the outcome even though the linear regression cannot explain much of the variability? this could happen when the predictors influence the outcome however does not account for most of its variability, or when there are many unmeasured factors that influence the outcome that are not taken into account of the model, or that the relationship between the predictor and outcome is non-linear which means the linear model cannot capture the scope of the relation."

    "our goal is to see how the model performs on both the tested data and the additional general data, as we can see it is clustered around the y=x line which means that generally, the model is accurate in depicting a true HP predictor. we can see that sometimes the out-of-sample is more suited for the model than the in-sample and this could happen because sometimes the test data may be easier to predict than the training data, this means that the model might be very suited for the whole population which could lead to the out-of-sample having a higher r-squared value. it could be possible as well that the in-sample could capture too many outliers such that the the r-squared value might be lower for the training set."

    " Here's a concise summary of our discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Building and Adjustments: We discussed several models, including model4, model5, model6, and model7. These models involved different specifications of predictor variables (e.g., Attack, Speed, Generation, Type), and we explored how the inclusion of additional features or transformations (like interaction terms or scaling) impacts the models' performance, especially in terms of R-squared values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting and Model Performance: You asked about overfitting when adding more predictors. We discussed that adding more variables can lead to overfitting, where the model performs very well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. However, some models (e.g., model5) were better than others, likely due to careful inclusion of relevant predictors, which improved out-of-sample generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction Effects: We explained the difference between addition (e.g., adding main effects of variables like Attack, Speed) versus multiplication (e.g., adding interaction terms like Attack * Speed * Sp. Def) in models. The latter allows the model to capture more complex relationships between variables, potentially improving predictive power, especially when interactions are significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared for In-sample and Out-of-sample: We explored R-squared values, both in-sample (how well the model fits the training data) and out-of-sample (how well the model generalizes to new data). You observed that sometimes out-of-sample R-squared can be higher than in-sample R-squared, which could indicate that the model generalizes well to unseen data, despite appearing to fit the training data less perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting Across Generations: We delved into how models like model7 and model6 were used to predict Pokémon data across different generations. By testing the models on data from generations not seen during training (out-of-sample), we evaluated how well the models could generalize. Additionally, we discussed different in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values when using models trained on specific subsets of the data (e.g., Generation 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Multiple R-squared Values: We clarified why there are two in-sample and two out-of-sample R-squared values in some parts of the analysis: one pair for the original model (trained on all generations) and another for models trained only on specific subsets (e.g., Generation 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall theme was evaluating model generalization and understanding the impact of various model adjustments (like adding features, interactions, and scaling) on performance across different datasets.\n",
